You are a helpful English assistant that helps to classify articles into categories and levels based on their content.
        please use the following rules or criteria for classifying articles. 
        Please return 2 arrays. 1. An array of categories names and 2. An array of levels.
        1. The categories should be determined by the article title matching to the following list: ['Activities & HobbiesAirport & DirectionsAnimals & PetsBeauty & FashionBookClothesCommunication & life skillsCulture & FestivalDuplicated filesEnvironmentFood & drinksFortune Teller & Fong suiGrammarHealthHobbies & GamesHow toInjury & issueJobs & BusinessLanguageListeningMoviesMusic & ArtNatureNew ArticlesNews & shows & celebritiesPlacesReadingRelationshipSafetySelf awareness & mental healthShopping & MoneySocial MediaSociety & TrendSportsStoryStudy & HistoryTechnologyTestTime & ProcastinationTOEICTransportation&InfrustructureTravelVoc testWeather & SeasonWishesWritting']
        2. The levels of the articles should be determined by the article content. Consider the levels being 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4. Consider the levels being for kids in Taiwan of grade 5, Junior high school 2, junior high school 3, Senior high school grade 1, senior high school grade 2 respectively. for example if the article contains simple vocabulary and sentence structure, let the level be 1. If the vocabulary and sentence structure are complex let it be level 4.

Initiated\\u2019 in 1927 by th\\u00e9 poet Don Blanding,\\n\\nLei Day began as a tribute to the Hawaiian custom of making and wearing leis.\\nThe idea was quickly adopted and Officially-recognized as a holiday in 1929, and leis\\nhave since become a symbol of local pride and cultural preservation.\\n\\nIn Hawaiian culture, leis are more than decorative\\u2019 garlands made from flowers,\\nshells, or feathers.

Leis\\nalso reflect the diversity* and beauty of the archipelago through the distinctive\\ncolors associated with each Hawaiian island. On the island of Hawaii, the largest of\\nthe state\\u2019s eight major islands, the traditional flower color is red. Similarly, Maui is\\nknown for its pink leis, while Oahu is celebrated for its yellow leis.\\n\\nToday, Lei Day is celebrated across Hawaii with numerous? activities that\\nhonor this iconic tradition. Among the highlights are lei-making conta where\\n\\n,\\n\\n10\\n\\nAdding to the lively atmosphere are traditional Hawaiian music and hula dancing. A\\nLei Queen is also selected to represent Hawaiian values and Participate in various \\u00b0\\npublic events.\\n\\n20 Through its annual\\u2019 celebration, Hawaii emphasizes the importance of a\\nconnection to nature, cultural pride, and sharing joy. Whether you\\u2019re a\\n\\nlocal or a visitor, Lei Day offers an opportunity to embrace the essence?\\n\\nof Hawaii\\u2019s culture.

The canvas\\u2019 is filled with fragmented\\u2019 figures in a scene\\nof agony\\u2019 and terror\\u00ae. The painting doesn\\u2019t depict the bombing itself, but rather\\nthe immediate aftermath and the emotional impact of the attack on innocent\\ncivilians\\u2019. The screaming horse, often interpreted as a symbol of the suffering\\npeople, dominates\\u2019 the composition. The bull, a traditional symbol of Spain, can\\nbe interpreted in various ways, representing either brutality or the resilience of the\\nSpanish people. A light bulb at the top of the painting serves as both a symbol of\\nhope and a reminder of the bombs that fell from above.\\n\\nPicasso\\u2019s genius lies in how he uses geometric shapes and distorted forms\\nto emphasize the emotional intensity\\u2019. The absence of color makes the scene\\neven more dramatic, forcing viewers to focus on the shapes and expressions.\\nThe painting\\u2019s large scale\\u2014measuring about 3.5 meters by 7.6 meters\\u2014makes it\\n\\u2018impossible for viewers to escape its impact.\\n\\nDespite being created nearly four centuries apart, these masterpieces continue\\nto speak to modern audiences about the timeless themes of death, destruction, and\\nhuman resilience.

This change aims to improve\\nsafety, streamline boarding, and maximize\\nefficiency, replacing the long-standing\\nand often debated practice of standing on\\none side. The shift also reflects growing\\nconcerns about balancing safety and\\noperational effectiveness in increasingly\\ncrowded stations.\\n\\nAdvocates for the new policy\\nemphasize its benefits. First, escalators\\nare not designed for walking, and moving\\non them poses safety risks, particularly\\nin crowded stations. Studies from the\\nLondon Underground demonstrate that\\nstanding on both sides can increase\\ntransport efficiency by 30%} \\u2018comp )a\\nstanding on one side. Moreover, examples\\nfrom other cities, like Guangzhou, reveal\\nthat the \\u201cstand on the right\\u201d practice\\ncauses significant wear, with 95% of the\\nright side experiencing greater damage,\\nraising long-term safety concerns.\\n\\nDespite these arguments, many\\n\\nry\\n\\na\\n\\np\\na\\n\\noppose\\u2019 the policy, citing\\u2019 long-standing\\nhabits and cultural norms\\u2019. Since the\\nTaipei Metro\\u2019s opening in 1996, the habit\\nof standing on the right has become\\ndeeply ingrained among passengers,\\nreinforced by campaigns that promoted\\nleaving the left side clear for those in\\na hurry. In Japan, a similar practice of\\nstanding on one side originated from\\nbusinesspeople carrying goods, creating\\na norm that persists\\u201d today. Critics\\u00ae argue\\nthat altering\\u2019 such entrenched habits will\\nrequire considerable time and effort.\\nUltimately, safety should be the top\\npriority. The Taipei Metro has opted?\\nfor flexibility, refraining from banning\\nwalking on the left side while promoting\\nmutual respect and safety. Through\\nannouncements and signage, the Taipei\\nMetro urges passengers to stand on both\\nsides to prevent accidents. Balancing\\nsafety, efficiency, and cultural habits\\n\\nremains a challenge, but prioritizing :\\n\\nrespect and collective well-being is a\\n\\nstep toward fostering a safer commuting \\u2014\\nBisRaRR Pd\\n\\nenvironment.\\n\\nPPE PLL LLL PPLE\\nOOP PAE PPLE EE PEP PE\\n\\n1? vocabuiary (A\\n\\n* 1. escalator [ \'eska,leta ] n.

This striking\\u2019 blue glass\\nornament\\u2019 is shaped like an eye with concentric circles of\\ndark blue, white, and light blue. 1\\n\\nThe origins of the nazar boncugu can be traced back\\nto ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern traditions. The\\nword nazar comes from Arabic, meaning \\u201cgaze,\\u201d while boncugu\\ntranslates to \\u201cbead\\u201d in Turkish. 2 According to local beliefs,\\nthese ill-intentioned looks can inflict? misfortune on a person or their\\npossessions.

Blue has long\\nbeen associated with divinity, peace, and protection in Byzantine and Ottoman\\ntraditions. 3 The circular, eye-like design is thought to keep constant\\nsurveillance\\u2019 and acts as a protective barrier against potential threats.\\n\\nThe nazar boncugu is seamlessly integrated\\u2019 into various aspects of\\ncontemporary Turkish life. It is commonly seen adorning jewelry, such as bracelets\\nand necklaces, worn daily as a personal protective charm. __4 __ Interestingly,\\nwhen a nazar boncugu shatters\\u2019, believers interpret it as a sign that the amulet has\\naccomplished its protective mission and must be immediately replaced.\\n\\nThe nazar boncugu represents a living tradition that bridges Tirkiye\\u2019s rich historical\\npast and its vibrant present. For those in search of a meaningful accessory that\\nembodies style and spirituality, the nazar boncugu is the perfect choice. ff) mis pp. 34-85\\n\\n@ Frequently seen alongside the nazar boncugu is the hamsa, an open hand with\\nfive fingers and an eye in the center.\\n\\n\\u00ae Additionally, it can be found in homes, often hung on walls or placed in living\\nspaces.\\n\\n@ Central to the nazar boncugu\\u2019s mythology is the idea that envy from others could\\ntransmit harmful energy through malicious glances. ;\\n\\n(D) While its name in English suggests something threatening, it\\u2019s actually a charm\\ndesigned to ward off misfortune.\\n@ |t also symbolizes heaven and water, elements linked to purity and calmness.\\nSSIREAAL P. 60\\n\\n<b\\u201d ono\\n1. striking [ \'strarkiy ] adj. 3) S$ BW; BA\\nA)\\n\\u00b0 The striking sunset painted the sky with\\nbrilliant shades of orange and purple.\\nAB S| AB Wy FRI 09 HE A HE BIRT\\n\\n2. ornament [ \\u2018ornament ] n. 48\\n\\n\\u00a2 The Christmas tree was covered with colorful\\nornaments and twinkling lights.\\n\\nEnid Cm 7 BAZ HOSE a AAMAS \\u00a9\\n\\n3. inflict [ m\'flikt ] vt. eS\\n\\ne The typhoon inflicted serious damage on the\\ncoastal towns.\\n\\nRE RUA SS eS ARERR SE \\u00a9\\n\\nx 4. shield [ fild ] vt.
